        <p>This project is a client-server application for monitoring health metrics from wearable devices. The server operates in a multi-threaded environment, allowing simultaneous connections from multiple clients over TCP, and logs all interactions for historical tracking.</p>

        <h5>Key Features</h5>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-Client Support:</strong> Handles multiple client connections concurrently, with each client interaction managed in a separate thread.</li>
            <li><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Clients can request metrics such as temperature, heart rate, and step count. The server responds with real-time data and logs each request.</li>
            <li><strong>Command-Based System:</strong> Clients send commands (e.g., TEMP, RATE, STEPS), and the server responds accordingly, maintaining counters and logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> The client app interprets responses, providing feedback like “Fever” for high temperatures or step goal progress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Workflow</h5>
        <p>Clients connect to the server, send commands, and receive responses based on their request. Each interaction is logged for analysis, offering a reliable solution for tracking health trends in IoT applications.</p>
